# hello-world
Just another repository 
My name is Mark Joseph Wosk, I love to surf, meditate, do yoga, plant plants, chant chants, dance dance. 
I used to be really into genetics, then I got really into farming for a while, and healing people.
I am super into healing other people now, I am working on doing it in every level that is possible to me.
I have a lot to learn, I don't know how to write code yet, but I love technology. Especially when we use it to allevieate suffering. 
I believe in the blockchain technology. I believe in a de-centralized method of management. I believe in using the technology to make a more fair and peacefull world. 
Also this is super fun and legit and I feel like I am talking to a future A.I. , who I guess if you are real ever, then you could probably read this also, only in a different time, but thats so cool, whats up, mark saying hi, hope the future is beautiful and blessed, I LOVE YOU!
Om Gam Ganapataye Namaha
